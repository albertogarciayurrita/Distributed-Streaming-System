# Distributed-Streaming-System
Personal long-term project to learn distributed systems concepts such as message partitioning, replication, and fault tolerance. Inspired by platforms like Apache Kafka, with educational purposes.

## 📌 Description
This project aims to implement a distributed system inspired in Kafka, developed in Java.

The idea is to understand on a practical level how a distributed message system works: producers, brokers and consumers, as well as the real problems associated with it (communication, decoupling, scalability, etc...).

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn the fundamentals of distributed systems
- Implement a Producer → Broker → Consumer flow
- Understand interprocess communication
- Practice good organizatioin and version control of practices with Git

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Java
- Git /Github
- VS Code

---

## 🧱 Architecture (temporary)
The system will initially consist of:

- **Producer**: generates messages
- **Broker**: recives messages and distributes them
- **Consumer**: consumes the messages sent by the broker

The architecture will be refined as the project progresses.

## 📂 Structure of the project
*(subject to change over time)*

/src
/producer
/broker
/consumer

## 📝 Current status
- Git Repository created
- Java proyect initialized
- Package and path issues resolved
- Repository located outside of OneDrive to avoid conflicts with Git

## 📚 Notes
- The project is being developed progressively, combining theoretical and practical learning.
- Documentation will be expanded as important design decisions are made.
